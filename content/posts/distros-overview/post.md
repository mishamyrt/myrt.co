# Distros overview

Date: February 2, 2017

Once upon a time i broke down X.org, so there was a need to reinstall the OS. I decided to stay on the Linux and chose between several distributions. My requirements:

1. Good support for GTK3.
2. Debian at the core.
3. Careful window manager with nice animations.

Below are the test results of distributions that fit the requirements.

## Ubuntu MATE 15.10

I'm not a fan of the classic dwarf at all. The support of GTK3 is quite average, and the most apps visually broken. The speed is great. It looks boring, most of the elements are not very well scaled to high pixel density and in the end everything is small.

## Ubuntu 15.10

I didn't like Unity it at all. The location of the elements is not logical, you have to spend a lot of time in some places to understand the purpose of this or that button. The standard window manager does not support transparency, which is quite sad. And of course it's worth mentioning application launcher panel called Unity Dash: it's ugly and unsuitable for use.

## Deepin 15

This distribution has appeared relatively recently, but has already managed to win the favor of thousands of users. The focus here is on the interface, but to me, it all looks super-crappy. It's all very overloaded, hundreds of buttons, sliders and stuff. It uses its own window manager, called a deepin-wm, which looks good, but severely loads RAM (about 700MB without open windows). The system has its own application store, which is 70% filled with Chinese unlocalized software. Support for GTK3 on a same level as Ubuntu.

## elementaryOS 0.4 Loki (Alpha version)

I'm not gonna sneak around, it's the one I've been pinning my hopes on. UI became even more beautiful, neater, small animations were added (for example, switching the state of the checkbox). There appeared an app store, the old software was a little bit finished, in general, everything is fine... If it were not for one old bug: switching the keyboard layout. Actually, it doesn't work, which means that the distribution kit is not suitable for use yet (of course, you can bother and implement the switch yourself, but I don't want to do it).

As a result, I'm back to elementaryOS 0.3.2, as long as I don't see any competitors for it.
